## What I found interesting:
What I found interesting about this article is how Lindsey Redd didnâ€™t originally plan to become a software engineer but discovered it through exploration in college. Her story shows that coding can be learned from scratch at anytime and that curiosity can open doors to new career paths. I was impressed by how she described software engineering as not just coding but also testing, deploying, and collaborating with others. I found it inspiring that she emphasizes both technical skills and soft skills like communication and teamwork as essential for success.

As you mentioned, software engineering involves many other aspects besides just coding. This ties back to what we discussed in the first couple days of class - software engineering includes the entire development lifecycle, and not just writing programs but also documentation, configuration data, libraries, etc.
